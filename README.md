# Bootstrap-Portfolio

A recreation of a previous basic portfolio project.

## Description

## Usage

This project was created to explore the use of Bootstrap to form a website.  It does not have full functionality (For example, the portfolio page contains placeholder images rather than linking to any projects.)
